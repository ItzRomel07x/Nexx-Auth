# NEXX AUTH - Multi-Tenant Authentication System

## Overview

NexxAuth is a comprehensive authentication system built as a multi-tenant SaaS platform. Each user (authenticated via Google Firebase) gets their own isolated authentication environment where they can create applications, manage users, and control access through API keys. The system provides enterprise-grade features including hardware ID locking, version control, blacklisting, webhook notifications, and comprehensive user management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript and Vite
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theming (light/dark mode support)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React Context for theme
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for user identity
- **Background Effects**: Custom particle system for enhanced UX

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: express-session with PostgreSQL store
- **Authentication**: Dual authentication system (Firebase + custom session management)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with multi-tenant isolation
- **Security**: CORS, rate limiting, API key validation, input sanitization

### Database Schema
The system uses a multi-tenant architecture with the following key tables:
- `users` - Main user accounts (Firebase authenticated)
- `applications` - User-created applications with unique API keys
- `app_users` - End users for each application (isolated per tenant)
- `license_keys` - License management system
- `webhooks` - Webhook configuration for real-time notifications
- `blacklist` - IP/username/email/HWID blocking system
- `activity_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail
- `sessions` - Session storage for authentication

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Primary Auth**: Firebase Google OAuth for tenant authentication
- **Secondary Auth**: Custom session-based authentication for application users
- **API Security**: API key-based authentication for external integrations
- **Permission System**: Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Moderator, User)

### Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Each Google account creates an isolated tenant environment
- API keys are tenant-specific and provide access only to that tenant's data
- Complete data isolation between tenants
- Separate user management for each tenant's applications

### Application Management
- Users can create multiple applications within their tenant
- Each application gets a unique API key for external integration
- Configurable security settings per application (HWID locking, version control)
- Custom messaging for different authentication scenarios

### Security Features
- **Hardware ID Locking**: Prevent account sharing across devices
- **Version Control**: Force application updates
- **Blacklist System**: Block by IP, username, email, or hardware ID
- **Account Expiration**: Time-based access control
- **Session Management**: Real-time session tracking and validation

### Webhook System
- Real-time notifications for authentication events
- Support for Discord, Slack, and custom webhook endpoints
- Configurable event types and payload formatting
- Automatic retry logic and failure handling

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow
1. User authenticates with Google Firebase
2. Backend creates tenant environment and user record
3. User can create applications and generate API keys
4. External applications use API keys to authenticate end users

### Authentication Flow
1. External application sends user credentials + API key to `/api/auth/login`
2. System validates API key and retrieves application configuration
3. User credentials are validated against application's user database
4. Security checks (HWID, version, blacklist, expiration) are performed
5. Authentication result is returned with session token
6. Webhook notifications are triggered for the event

### Admin Flow
1. Tenant owners can manage users, applications, and settings
2. Permission system controls access to different administrative functions
3. Activity logs track all administrative actions
4. Real-time updates via React Query for responsive UI

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL database connectivity
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **firebase/auth**: User authentication via Google
- **express**: Web server framework
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **wouter**: Lightweight routing
- **react-hook-form**: Form management with validation

### Security Dependencies
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing
- **express-session**: Session management
- **cors**: Cross-origin resource sharing

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with Node.js 20
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless)
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and HMR
- **Dev Server**: Express with Vite middleware integration

### Production Deployment
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles backend
- **Static Assets**: Frontend builds to `dist/public`, served by Express
- **Environment Variables**: Database URL, Firebase config, session secrets
- **Autoscaling**: Configured for Replit autoscale deployment

### Database Management
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Migrations**: Schema changes tracked in `migrations/` directory
- **Connection**: Neon serverless with WebSocket support for edge environments
